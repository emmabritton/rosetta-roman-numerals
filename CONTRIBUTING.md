Thanks for helping others!

## How to contribute

### Report bugs
If some or all of the implementations incorrectly convert or have other bugs please submit an issue 

### Missed test cases
If you want to implement the test case if some or all of the languages then submit a pull request but if you just know of common but missed numeral feel free to submit an issue:

### Add implementation
Your implementation must follow the [specification](https://https://github.com/raybritton/rosetta-roman-numerals/blob/master/SPECIFICATION.md).
Submit a pull request with the code, tests and readme explaining how to execute the program and tests.
Don't forget to include a gitignore file for your language and IDE with your implementation. You can easily generate this at [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io)
